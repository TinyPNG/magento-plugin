# Compress JPEG & PNG images for Magento 1

Make your Magento 1 store faster by compressing your JPEG and PNG images.

This extension automatically optimizes your images by integrating with the
popular image compression services TinyJPG and TinyPNG.

Learn more about TinyJPG and TinyPNG at https://tinypng.com/.

Do you use Magento 2? Install the Magento 2 extension instead:

## How does it work?

When you view a product in your webshop, Magento creates different image sizes
in its cache folders. This extension will compress these images for you
automatically. Any image sizes that are exact duplicates of each other will
only be compressed once.

Your product images are uploaded to the TinyJPG or TinyPNG service and
analyzed to apply the best possible compression. Based on the content of the
image an optimal strategy is chosen. The result is sent back to your Magento
webshop and saved in your public media folder.

On average JPEG images are compressed by 40-60% and PNG images by 50-80%
without visible loss in quality. Your webshop will load faster for your
visitors, and you’ll save storage space and bandwidth!

## Getting started

Obtain your free API key from https://tinypng.com/developers. The first 500
compressions per month are completely free, no strings attached! As each
product will be shown in different sizes, between 50 and 100 products can be
uploaded to your Magento webshop and compressed for free. You can also change
which of types of image sizes should be compressed.

If you’re a heavy user, you can compress additional images for a small
additional fee per image by upgrading your account. You can keep track of the
amount of compressions in the Magento 1 configuration section.

## Installation

Copy the extension key from Magento Connect. Login on your webshop backend
and open *System -> Magento Connect -> Magento Connect Manager*.
Paste the extension key to install the extension.

After installation, go to *System -> Configuration -> Image Optimization*, and
enter your TinyPNG API Key. Flush the images cache to start compressing.
